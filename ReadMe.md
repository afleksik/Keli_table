▎Overview

This project is a Cayley Table generator that describes the structure of finite algebraic systems with a single binary operation. It determines whether a group is Abelian and finds the core of the group, along with inverse elements.

▎Features

- Generate Cayley Table for any finite group.
- Supports operations: addition (+) and multiplication ().
- Allows creation of groups modulo a specified number.
- Displays element orders.

▎Usage

1. Run the script. 
2. Select an operation: "+" or "".
3. Decide if you want to create a group modulo a number. 
4. Enter the number for the group. 
5. For modulo groups, choose if elements should be mutually prime to the entered number.

▎Example

- Input: 
Enter operation: +
Enter number: 5


- Output: 
Cayley Table printed for the selected operation and elements.

▎Requirements

- Python 3.x
